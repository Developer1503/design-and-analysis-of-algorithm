## ⚙ Setup & Compilation
To compile and run any C program, use:

```sh
gcc filename.c -o outputfile
./outputfile
```

For example, to compile and run the Bellman-Ford algorithm:
```sh
gcc bellman\ ford.c -o bellman_ford
./bellman_ford
```

For Jupyter Notebook execution, ensure Python is installed, then run:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
